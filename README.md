# Minesweeper

## Current task

### 08/09/2018
I have fixed the cell reveal function. The text assosciated with the cell view is also showing now. 

I need to implement:

* functionality where the cell view gets the number of neighbouring bombs and displays it. 

* right-click flag function.

* bombs left

* score based on time

* user-interface for the window (to start a new game)

* different board size
